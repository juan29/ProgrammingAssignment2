## Write a short comment describing this function
## y is a square matrix in the global environment
## flag is used to verify if inverse  has been change
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  flag <- "FALSE"
  x <<- y
  print(x)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## uses matrix x, and calculate inverse

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  if (flag == "FALSE)" {
    flag <- "TRUE"
    x <<- y
    print(X)
    print (y)
    inverse <<- solve(x)
